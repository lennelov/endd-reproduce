# Structure
The project contains three main code folders:

## models
Should contain model implementations in the format of modules that can imported into other
parts of the project. This directory should not contain scripts.


## scripts
Should contain scripts for training, evaluating, or doing other tasks. All code intended for execution should
go in this folder.


## utils
Should contain general utility code handling things such as I/O or preprocessing.
